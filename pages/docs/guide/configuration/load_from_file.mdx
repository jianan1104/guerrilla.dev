## Method 2: Load Configuration from a YAML File

Create a file named `config.yaml` with the following content:
  
```yaml showLineNumbers filename="config.yaml"
name: EDR-G9010
type: mxros
protocol: ssh
host: 192.168.127.254
username: admin
password: moxa
```

This YAML file contains the configuration settings for the device.

### Python Code to Load YAML Configuration

To read the YAML file, you will need the `PyYAML` library. Install it using pip if you haven't already:
```bash
pip install PyYAML
```
Then, use the following Python script to load the configuration from `config.yaml`:

```py
from guerrilla.utils import load


config = load('config.yaml')
print(config)
```

This script imports the `load` module and defines a function load to read a YAML file from the specified path. 
The `guerrilla.utild.load` function parses the file content into a Python dictionary. Finally, the script reads `config.yaml` and prints its content.

Ensure that your YAML file's path matches the one specified in the script. 
This example assumes the YAML file is located in the same directory as your Python script.
