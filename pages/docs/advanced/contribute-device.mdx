# Tutorial: Contribute a Custom Device Class to Guerrilla SDK


In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of creating a custom device class by extending the `BaseDevice` class. 
This approach allows you to implement device-specific functionalities while leveraging the generic session management capabilities provided by `BaseDevice`. 
For illustration, we'll create a custom class for a hypothetical device type called `AWK`.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you read the [Custom Device](/docs/advanced/custom_device) guide to understand the Guerrilla SDK's device architecture and the role of the `BaseDevice` class.

<Steps>

### Step 1: Add Device Constant to `DeviceType`

First, add a new constant to the `DeviceType` enum to represent the new device type. This constant will be used to identify the device type when creating instances of the custom device class.

```py {5} filename="src/guerrilla/utils/constant.py" showLineNumbers
class DEVICE(Enum):
    MXROS = "mxros"
    MXNOS = "mxnos"
    LINUX = "linux"
    AWK = "awk" # Add the new device type constant here

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, str):
            return self.value == other
        return super().__eq__(other)
```

### Step 2: Add Device Factory Method to `DeviceFactory`

Next, add a new factory method to the `DeviceFactory` class to create instances of the custom device class based on the device type constant defined in the previous step.

```py {21-24} filename="src/guerrilla/device/device.py" showLineNumbers
@dataclass
class Device:
    config: dict

    def __new__(cls, config: dict):
        device_model: str = config.get("type", None)
        device_model = device_model.lower()
        match device_model:
            case DEVICE.MXROS:
                from .mxros import MXROS

                return MXROS(config)
            case DEVICE.MXNOS:
                from .mxnos import MXNOS

                return MXNOS(config)
            case DEVICE.LINUX:
                from .linux import Linux

                return Linux(config)
            case DEVICE.AWK:  # Add the new device type case here
                from .awk import AWK # put the custom device python in src/guerrilla/device/awk/awk.py

                return AWK(config)
            case _:
                from .base import BaseDevice

                logger.warning(
                    f"Device type {device_model} not implemented, use BaseDevice instead"
                )
                return BaseDevice(config)
```

### Step 3: Utilize Your Custom Device Class

With the custom device class defined, you can now create instances of `AWK` and use them to manage your network devices. Here's how you can instantiate and use your custom device:


```py
from guerrilla import Device
device_config = {
    "name": "device1",
    "type": "awk",  # Use the new device type constant here
    "protocol": "ssh",  # Assuming your SessionFactory supports this
    "host": "192.168.1.100",
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "admin123",
}

my_device = Device(device_config)
my_device.connect()

output = my_device.custom_command()
print(output)
my_device.disconnect()
```
</Steps>

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've walked through the process of creating a custom device class by extending the `BaseDevice` class. We've also seen how to utilize the custom device class to manage network devices. By following these steps, you can contribute a custom device class to Guerrilla SDK and extend its capabilities to support new device types.

Don't forget to create a pull request to contribute your custom device class to the Guerrilla SDK repository. We look forward to seeing your contributions!
